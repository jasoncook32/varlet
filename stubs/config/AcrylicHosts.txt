# This is the AcrylicHosts.txt file.
#
# The standard format is: IPADDRESS DOMAINNAME1 [DOMAINNAME2] [DOMAINNAME3] and DOMAINNAME3 are strings.
# A line starting with the '#' character (and everything after it if it's found within a line) is considered a comment
# and therefore ignored.
#
# Domain names can contain wildcard characters '*' (matches zero or more characters) and '?' (matches exactly one char):
#
# 127.0.0.1 ad.* ads.*
# 127.0.0.1 /^ads?\..*$
#
# A '>' character at the beginning of a domain name is a convenient shortcut for representing all domain names ending
# with what follows after that character. For example an entry like this one:
#
# 127.0.0.1 >google.com
#
# Is equivalent to:
#
# 127.0.0.1 google.com *.google.com
#
# NXDOMAIN responses and FORWARD entries can also be mapped to domain names using all of the possibilities (i.e.
# wildcard characters & regular expressions) already explained above:
#
# NX www.google.com
# NX >google.com
# NX /^ads?\..*$
#
# FORWARD entries are always evaluated first and can be effectively used to specify exceptions to other rules. For
# example a configuration like this one:
#
# FW >google.com
# NX *
#
